Welcome to Born-Digital Bootcamp!
=================================

The following instructions will help you get started with our Collections Services born-digital processing project and earn the much-coveted **Digital Archives Pin**!

Things to know:
---------------

* Each person is responsible for twenty pieces of born-digital media from the Nathaniel Mackey papers. The bulk of the digital media included in the Mackey papers are 3.5" floppy disks, but there are also a handful of 5.25" floppy disks and optical discs. It doesn't matter which of these disks you work on, providing you complete the process for twenty pieces of media.
* For each piece of digital media, each person will complete the following tasks:
	* :ref:`Capturing a disk image using either the KryoFlux (for floppy disks) or dd (for optical discs). <KryoFlux_setup>`
	* :ref:`Migrating the disk image to a format suitable for ingest into the Keep. <img_migration>`
	* :ref:`Generating a Fiwalk report for each disk image and scanning each disk image for viruses. <fiwalk_and_clamav>`
	* :ref:`Preparing the disk image and any supplemental files for ingest into the Keep using BagIt. <creatingBags>`
	* Ingesting each packaged disk image into the Keep and completing Keep object metadata records.
* Each person will be a assigned a range of numbers that you should use as unique identifiers for your twenty disk images. These will replace the identifiers previously assigned by Laura. Identifiers are assigned as follows:
	* ERR:  1297_03 - 1297_23
	* JB:	1297_24 - 1297_44
	* CH:	1297_45 - 1297_65
	* LS:	1297_66 - 1297_86
	* SQ:	1297_87 - 1297_107
	* MO: 	1297_108 - 1297_128
	* CB:	1297_129 - 1297_149
	* RTS:	1297_150 - 1297_170
	* DW: 	Whatever remains
* Each person will find an envelope in the lab with their name on it. Please use this envelope to store disks as you complete the imaging process. As you make progress, you may need to get a larger envelope/box.
* All Born-Digital Bootcamp documentation will be made available on this site. If you have any feedback or questions about the documentation, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
